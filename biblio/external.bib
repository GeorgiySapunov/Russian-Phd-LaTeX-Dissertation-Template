abstract = {We report on selective-area growth of vertically aligned GaAs nanowires on Si(111) substrate. Modification of the initial Si(111) surface by pretreatment under an AsH3 atmosphere and low-temperature growth of GaAs were important for controlling the growth orientations of the GaAs nanowire on the Si(111) surface. We also found that the size of openings strongly affected the growth morphology of GaAs nanowires on Si(111). Small diameter openings reduced the antiphase defects and improved the optical properties in the GaAs nanowires. Moreover, we realized coherent growth without misfit dislocation at the GaAs/Si interface. Finally, we demonstrated fabrication of a GaAs/AlGaAs core–shell nanowire array on a Si surface and revealed that the luminescence intensity was markedly enhanced by passivation effects. These results are promising for future III–V nanowire-based optoelectronic integration on Si platforms.},

abstract = {We study the structural and chemical transformations induced by focused laser beam in GaAs nanowires with an axial zinc-blende/wurtzite (ZB/WZ) heterostructure. The experiments are performed using a combination of transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Raman scattering, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. For both the components of heterostructure, laser irradiation under atmospheric air is found to produce a double surface layer which is composed of crystalline arsenic and of amorphous GaOx. The latter compound is responsible for the appearance of a peak at 1.76 eV in photoluminescence spectra of GaAs nanowires. Under an increased laser power density, due to sample heating, evaporation of the surface crystalline arsenic and formation of $\beta$-Ga2O3 nanocrystals proceed on the surface of the zinc-blende part of nanowire. The formed nanocrystals reveal a photoluminescence band in a visible range of 1.7-2.4 eV. At the same power density for wurtzite part of the nanowire, total amorphization with the formation of $\beta$-Ga2O3 nanocrystals occurs. Observed transformation of WZ-GaAs to $\beta$-Ga2O3 nanocrystals presents an available way for the creation of axial and radial heterostructures ZB-GaAs/$\beta$-Ga2O3 for optoelectronic and photonic applications.},

Compared with the one-step approach, the two-step growth scheme has been found to be a better pathway to obtain a superior-quality GaAs on Si. Taking advantages of low energy for both Si(111) surface and GaAs/Si(111) interface, the two-step grown GaAs of total ∼175 nm atop patterned Si(111) substrates exhibits atomically smooth surface morphology, single crystallininty and a remarkably low defect density. A low-temperature GaAs nucleation layer of the two-step growth helps relieve the misfit stress by accommodating the misfit dislocations at the very adjacent GaAs/Si interface. The excellent properties of the two-step grown GaAs were investigated and verified by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy.

It has been shown theoretically that modification of the PL spectrum of p-type material by p-type doping is very small due to the large valence-band hole effective mass. The PL spectrum of n-type material is affected by two factors: (1) the electron concentration which determines the Fermi level in the material; (2) the thickness of the film due to re-absorption of the PL signal. For the n-type GaAs thin films under current investigation, the doping level as well as the film thickness can be very well calibrated by the PL spectrum when the doping level is less than 2 × 1018 cm-3 and the film thickness is in the range of the penetration length of the PL excitation laser.},

@article{Oulton2009,
abstract = {Laser science has been successful in producing increasingly high-powered, faster and smaller coherent light sources. Examples of recent advances are microscopic lasers that can reach the diffraction limit, based on photonic crystals, metal-clad cavities and nanowires. However, such lasers are restricted, both in optical mode size and physical device dimension, to being larger than half the wavelength of the optical field, and it remains a key fundamental challenge to realize ultracompact lasers that can directly generate coherent optical fields at the nanometre scale, far beyond the diffraction limit. A way of addressing this issue is to make use of surface plasmons, which are capable of tightly localizing light, but so far ohmic losses at optical frequencies have inhibited the realization of truly nanometre-scale lasers based on such approaches. A recent theoretical work predicted that such losses could be significantly reduced while maintaining ultrasmall modes in a hybrid plasmonic waveguide. Here we report the experimental demonstration of nanometre-scale plasmonic lasers, generating optical modes a hundred times smaller than the diffraction limit. We realize such lasers using a hybrid plasmonic waveguide consisting of a high-gain cadmium sulphide semiconductor nanowire, separated from a silver surface by a 5-nm-thick insulating gap. Direct measurements of the emission lifetime reveal a broad-band enhancement of the nanowireĝ€™s exciton spontaneous emission rate by up to six times owing to the strong mode confinement and the signature of apparently threshold-less lasing. Because plasmonic modes have no cutoff, we are able to demonstrate downscaling of the lateral dimensions of both the device and the optical mode. Plasmonic lasers thus offer the possibility of exploring extreme interactions between light and matter, opening up new avenues in the fields of active photonic circuits, bio-sensing and quantum information technology. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

The growth is catalyzed by liquid Ga droplets formed in the openings of a native oxide layer at the initial growth stage. Transmission electron microscopy studies demonstrate that the nanowires are single crystals having the zincblende structure along their length (apart from a thin wurtzite region directly below the Ga droplet), regardless of their diameter (70-80 nm) and the growth temperature range (560-630°C). We attribute the observed phase purity to a much lower surface energy of liquid Ga than that of Au-Ga alloys, which makes triple line nucleation energetically unfavorable. The change in growth catalyst to a liquid metal with a lower energy suppresses the (more usual) formation of wurtzite nuclei on surface energetic grounds. These results can provide a distinct method for the fabrication of chemically pure and stacking-fault-free zincblende nanowires of III-V compounds on silicon. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The main challenge for light-emitting diodes is to increase the efficiency in the green part of the spectrum. Gallium phosphide (GaP) with the normal cubic crystal structure has an indirect band gap, which severely limits the green emission efficiency. Band structure calculations have predicted a direct band gap for wurtzite GaP. Here, we report the fabrication of GaP nanowires with pure hexagonal crystal structure and demonstrate the direct nature of the band gap. We observe strong photoluminescence at a wavelength of 594 nm with short lifetime, typical for a direct band gap. Furthermore, by incorporation of aluminum or arsenic in the GaP nanowires, the emitted wavelength is tuned across an important range of the visible light spectrum (555-690 nm). This approach of crystal structure engineering enables new pathways to tailor materials properties enhancing the functionality. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

An increase in the temperature to 640°C suppresses the formation of nanowires. The method that provides a means for the fabrication of purely cubic GaAs nanowires is described.

A mechanism can be developed to control the molecular dynamic movement on modified semiconductor surface by dopants thus changing the effect of the electric field on the active molecules. In this study, the Si(111) surface was doped with phosphorus excessively using thermal diffusion process. The surface was then reconstructed to the 7 × 7 configuration via heating under UHV conditions and then studied through STM and STS techniques. The protrusions due to surface and subsurface P atoms appear brighter due to the lone electron pair. The 7 × 7 reconstruction would be destabilized after a critical P substitution of Si-adatom concentration due to high surface strain result in P-terminated (6√3 × 6√3)R30{\textordmasculine} reconstruction.},

The results are compared to density functional theory calculations. Experiment and theory show that the occurrence of hexagonal bilayers tends to stretch the distances of atomic layers parallel to the c axis and to reduce the in-plane distances compared to those in zinc blende. The change of the lattice parameters scales linearly with the hexagonality of the polytype, defined as the fraction of bilayers with hexagonal character within one unit cell. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

Specifically, the refractive index for the polymer film was tuned from 1.46 to 1.54 using silica nanoparticle loadings from 50 to 0 wt{\%} and from 1.54 to 1.95 using ceria nanoparticle loadings from 0 to 90 wt{\%}, respectively. The low and high refractive index layers are then combined to create an anti-reflective coating which exhibits a reflectance spectrum, abrasion resistance, haze and transmission values that compare well with those produced using state-of-the-art vacuum based techniques. Furthermore, the results show that it is possible to begin with aqueous dispersions and then dilute them with organic solvents for use in a spin coating method to prepare the polymer–metal oxide nanoparticle composite films.},

Catalytically grown nanowires are ideal systems for studying the fundamental physics of phase selection, and could lead to new electronic applications based on the engineering of crystal phases. Here we image gallium arsenide (GaAs) nanowires during growth as they switch between phases as a result of varying growth conditions. We find clear differences between the growth dynamics of the phases, including differences in interface morphology, step flow and catalyst geometry. We explain these differences, and the phase selection, using a model that relates the catalyst volume, the contact angle at the trijunction (the point at which solid, liquid and vapour meet) and the nucleation site of each new layer of GaAs. This model allows us to predict the conditions under which each phase should be observed, and use these predictions to design GaAs heterostructures. These results could apply to phase selection in other nanowire systems.},

A variety of shorter and longer segments of zinc-blende or wurtzite crystal phases are observed by transmission electron microscopy in the nanowires. Sharp photoluminescence lines are observed with emission energies tuned from 1.515 eV down to 1.43 eV when the percentage of wurtzite is increased. The downward shift of the emission peaks can be understood by carrier confinement at the interfaces, in quantum wells and in random short period superlattices existent in these nanowires, assuming a staggered band offset between wurtzite and zinc-blende GaAs. The latter is confirmed also by time-resolved measurements. The extremely local nature of these optical transitions is evidenced also by cathodoluminescence measurements. Raman spectroscopy on single wires shows different strain conditions, depending on the wurtzite content which affects also the band alignments.

abstract = {Hybrid nanostructures are a class of materials that are typically composed of two or more different components, in which each component has at least one dimension on the nanoscale. The rational design and controlled synthesis of hybrid nanostructures are of great importance in enabling the fine tuning of their properties and functions. Epitaxial growth is a promising approach to the controlled synthesis of hybrid nanostructures with desired structures, crystal phases, exposed facets and/or interfaces. This Review provides a critical summary of the state of the art in the field of epitaxial growth of hybrid nanostructures. We discuss the historical development, architectures and compositions, epitaxy methods, characterization techniques and advantages of epitaxial hybrid nanostructures. Finally, we provide insight into future research directions in this area, which include the epitaxial growth of hybrid nanostructures from a wider range of materials, the study of the underlying mechanism and determining the role of epitaxial growth in influencing the properties and application performance of hybrid nanostructures.},

abstract = {In order to obtain a high current amplification factor, it is important in transistors that the ratio of the injected minority carrier current over the total emitter current, $\gamma$, be close to unity, or that the quantity 1-$\gamma$, called the injection deficit, be as small as possible. It is shown that the injection deficit of an emitter can be decreased by several orders of magnitude if the emitter has a higher band gap than the base region. This effect can be utilized either in addition to the commonly used high emitter doping in order to eliminate the alpha falloff with current, or to decrease the high emitter doping in order to obtain a lower emitter capacitance. Decreasing the emitter capacitance in high-frequency transistors may be utilized either to extend their frequency range or to increase their power capabilities by increasing the area.

It is shown that the nanowire formation is controlled by surface diffusion of indium adatoms whose concentration on the sidewalls determines the local radial growth rate. Two models for the radial growth rate are considered, with linear (step flow) and exponential (two-dimensional nucleation) dependences on the adatom concentration. The linear model reproduces fairly well the vertical elongation rate and the observed shapes of the upper nanowire parts, while the non-linear shapes at the nanowire bottom are described correctly only within the exponential model. We estimate the effective migration lengths of indium, which are of the order of several hundreds of nanometers between 400 and 450 °C. The migration length increases up to 2200 nm at 480 °C so that radial growth is completely suppressed at this high growth temperature.},

abstract = {A thermodynamic theory of the growth of semiconductor nanowhisker (NW) crystals according to the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism has been developed. An expression is proposed for the effective surface energy of the system, which is considered as a function of the NW radius and the contact angle of a liquid catalyst drop. Minimization of the surface energy leads to two possible modes of the VLS growth. In a standard mode that is realized when the Nebolsin-Shchetinin-Glas (NSC) condition is valid, the drop is not wetting the side surface of the NW. In the opposite case, the growth proceeds in a wetting mode, whereby the drop spreads about the NW top. It is shown for the first time that, even when the NSC condition is valid, the effective surface energy has two minima separated by a barrier and the minimum corresponding to the wetting mode is lower than that for the non-wetting mode. The results are applied to an analysis of the polytypism observed for GaAs nanowhiskers grown with Au and Ga catalysts. {\textcopyright} 2012 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract = {Self-assembled nanowires offer the prospect of accurate and scalable device engineering at an atomistic scale for applications in electronics, photonics and biology. However, deterministic nanowire growth and the control of dopant profiles and heterostructures are limited by an incomplete understanding of the role of commonly used catalysts and specifically of their interface dynamics. Although catalytic chemical vapour deposition of nanowires below the eutectic temperature has been demonstrated in many semiconductor-catalyst systems, growth from solid catalysts is still disputed and the overall mechanism is largely unresolved. Here, we present a video-rate environmental transmission electron microscopy study of Si nanowire formation from Pd silicide crystals under disilane exposure. A Si crystal nucleus forms by phase separation, as observed for the liquid Au-Si system, which we use as a comparative benchmark. The dominant coherent Pd silicide/Si growth interface subsequently advances by lateral propagation of ledges, driven by catalytic dissociation of disilane and coupled Pd and Si diffusion. Our results establish an atomistic framework for nanowire assembly from solid catalysts, relevant also to their contact formation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {The development of growth techniques aimed at the fabrication of nanoscale heterostructures with layers of ferroic 3 d metals on semiconductor substrates is very important for their potential usage in magnetic media recording applications. A structural study is presented of single-crystal nickel island ensembles grown epitaxially on top of CaF 2 /Si insulator-on-semiconductor heteroepitaxial substrates with (111), (110) and (001) fluorite surface orientations. The CaF 2 buffer layer in the studied multilayer system prevents the formation of nickel silicide, guides the nucleation of nickel islands and serves as an insulating layer in a potential tunneling spin injection device. The present study, employing both direct-space and reciprocal-space techniques, is a continuation of earlier research on ferromagnetic 3 d transition metals grown epitaxially on non-magnetic and magnetically ordered fluorides. It is demonstrated that arrays of stand-alone faceted nickel islands with a face-centered cubic lattice can be grown controllably on CaF 2 surfaces of (111), (110) and (001) orientations. The proposed two-stage nickel growth technique employs deposition of a thin seeding layer at low temperature followed by formation of the islands at high temperature. The application of an advanced three-dimensional mapping technique exploiting reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) has proved that the nickel islands tend to inherit the lattice orientation of the underlying fluorite layer, though they exhibit a certain amount of {\{}111{\}} twinning. As shown by scanning electron microscopy, grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) and grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS), the islands are of similar shape, being faceted with {\{}111{\}} and {\{}100{\}} planes. The results obtained are compared with those from earlier studies of Co/CaF 2 epitaxial nanoparticles, with special attention paid to the peculiarities related to the differences in lattice structure of the deposited metals: the dual-phase hexagonal close-packed/face-centered cubic lattice structure of cobalt as opposed to the single-phase face-centered cubic lattice structure of nickel.},

@article{Faucher2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Vacuum Society. Incorporating a Ge junction into a lattice-matched GaInP/GaAs/GaInNAsSb triple-junction cell grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) could enable concentrated efficiencies of ∼50{\%}. Epitaxial integration allows lift-off and wafer bonding steps to be avoided, but growth of III-Vs on Ge by MBE can lead to antiphase domains (APD) and stacking fault pyramids (SFP), both of which diminish solar cell performance. Initiating growth by migration-enhanced epitaxy (MEE) is typically cited as necessary to obtain high-quality III-Vs on Ge. In this work, the authors show that typical MEE growth conditions force a compromise between APD height (hAPD) and SFP density ($\rho$SFP). As APDs can readily self-terminate while SFPs cannot, a two-step initiation strategy was employed, where MEE is performed under conditions that minimize $\rho$SFP followed by low-temperature MBE conditions that encourage APD termination. By doing so, the authors obtained $\rho$SFP {\textless} 104cm-2 with hAPD ≤ 57 nm. The authors also demonstrated that high-quality GaAs on Ge can be grown without MEE initiation using conventional MBE conditions, though with taller APDs. Both the two-step initiation and conventional MBE initiation yield GaAs cells with high open-circuit voltage and internal quantum efficiency, demonstrating promising paths toward epitaxial integration of high-efficiency solar cells on Ge.},

abstract = {We have theoretically studied the formation of InAs quantum dots (QDs) on the side surface of GaAs nanowires (NWs). The effective energies of formation of a thin InAs layer and QDs on the NW side surface are compared with allowance for elastic stresses at the radial heteroboundary of two materials with lattice mismatch. The concept of a critical thickness of the external (wetting) layer is introduced, at which the mechanical stresses stimulate three-dimensional growth of QDs. The dependence of the critical layer thickness on the NW diameter and elastic constants of the system is determined. The phenomenon of partial filling of the NW side surface by QDs is explained by a decrease in the thickness of a deposited InAs layer with increasing height. The results of modeling agree well with the available experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

Transmission electron microscopy observations revealed that few threading defects such as stacking faults and threading dislocations are detected in GaP/Si by MEE. In addition, a regular network of misfit dislocations was generated during the lattice relaxation process. On the other hand, stacking faults were generated in high density at the hetero-interface and threading dislocations as well as interfacial misfit dislocations were observed in GaP/Si by MBE. The generation of stacking faults would be related to the coalescence or expansion of isolated GaP islands and the presence of stacking faults would affect the generation of threading dislocations. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

We demonstrated single interfaces that are defect-free and close to atomically abrupt, as well as quantum dots (i.e., Ge layers tens of atomic planes thick) embedded within Si wires. Real-time imaging of growth kinetics reveals that a low solubility of Si and Ge in the solid particle accounts for the interfacial abruptness.
